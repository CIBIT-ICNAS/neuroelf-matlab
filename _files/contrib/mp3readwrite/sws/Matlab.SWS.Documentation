DOCUMENTATION FOR MATLAB SINEWAVE SYNTHESIS (SWS)v1.70 March 9, 2000I.	INSTALLING THE SWS PACKAGE IN MATLAB1.	All the routines necessary to run the SWS Package are contained inthe folder titled SineWaveSyn. Download this folder and drag it to your MATLAB folder on your hard drive.2.	In order for Matlab to recognize the SineWaveSyn folder you needto add the folder to the Matlab path.  To do this, start MATLAB and goWINDOW::MATLAB PATH. Find and highlight the SineWaveSyn folder in thewindow on the left side of the screen and click on the APPEND button toadd the folder to the MATLAB directory structure.  If the folder hasbeen added, it will appear in the window on the right side of thescreen. When you are done, click on SAVE and then CLOSE.Note:	Sometimes, even after you have added a folder to the MATLABdirectory structure it will not be recognized.  If this happens, the wayto get around this is to open a file from within Matlab using theFILE::OPEN command.  This forces MATLAB to update its directorycontents.II.	RUNNING SWS1.	Start up Matlab and type SWS at command line to initialize GUI.III.	SWS MENUS1.	FILE::ABOUT. Provides information about the current version of SWS, including Overview setion, a Notes section, and a section on using SciconSTK files in SWS.2.	FILE::OPEN PARAMETER. Opens SWS input files (*.SWI and *.SWX) and generates a sound output at the sampling rate set in the Preferences(default=22050 Hz).  A brief description of each file format is provided in the Notes section under FILE::ABOUT.2.	FILE::SAVE PARAMETER. Save edited or interactively created file inSWI or SWX format, depending on format selected in Preferences.3.	FILE::OPEN AUDIO. Open an .AU or .WAV file.4.	FILE::SAVE AUDIO. Save synthesized output in .AU or .WAV formatdepending on setting in Preferences (default=.WAV format). Sampling ratefor saved files	must be the same as the sampling rate at which theaudio was synthesized. Changing the sampling rate option in thePreferences will not cause the data to be resampled so this will lead toproblems is you synthesize a sound and save it at different samplingrates.5.	FILE::PREFERENCES.a.	Set choice for saving Paramet file as .SWI or .SWX.b.	Set choice for saving audio files as .AU or .WAV.c.	Set sampling rate at which audio is synthesized/saved.d.	Set/Update amplitude scaling for Waveform display.6.	DATA::LIST. Displays the values from the Parameter files. For historicalreason, Pararmeter files are always displayed in .SWI format. As indicated inthe FILE::ABOUT Notes section, data is no longer automatically re-listedafter editing data.7.	DATA::DISPLAY. Pseudo-spectrogram display. As with the earlier VAX version,the width of a line at a given point indicates the relative amplitudefor that oscillator. Default display is the duration of the SWI output,but as much or as little time as desired can be displayed. As with LIST, datais no longer automatically re-displayed after editing data.8.	DATA::ZOOM. Zoom in on a section of the Display window. Onceenabled, click on a section of the display window and drag the mouse toform a box around the area on which you wish to zoom.  To reset thedisplay, simply double-click. Make sure to disable the function once youare done.9.	DATA::WAVE. This option allows you to see the shape of thewaveform and the amplitude on the y-axis. Amplitude is eitherauto-scaled to between min/max or set to the -1/+1 range (default) andcan be switched in the Preferences. The x-axis displays time informationin samples.10.	EDIT DATA::DELETE SINEWAVE.	Guess. In order to delete more than one sinewaveeither separate the Sinewave numbers by spaces (1 3 5) or use the colon (1 4:6 will delete sinewaves 1 and 4-6).11.	EDIT DATA::MULTIPLY. This option allows you to multiply theFrequency, Amplitude, or Time Values by a scalar. In order to multiplyvalues for more than one sinewave, separate the SineWave numbers byspaces. Ex. 1 3 512.	EDIT DATA::ADD. This option allows you to add a scalar to theFrequency, Amplitude, or Time Values. Use negative numbers to subtract(e.g., -.2) As with the MULTIPLY option, in order to add a value formore than one SineWave, separate the sinewave numbers by spaces. Ex. 1 3513. EDIT::CREATE HARMONIC. Create Harmonics of a single sinewave.14.	EDIT:CALCULATE AVERAGE.	Calculate the average frequency and amplitude forall sinewaves between START and END times.IV.	NOTES1.	If you are dealing with large files (10 seconds/30+oscillators) I do not know at what point SWS will crash, so be carefuland report any problems to Phil Rubin (rubin@tom.haskins.yale.edu).Good luck,Steve Frost
